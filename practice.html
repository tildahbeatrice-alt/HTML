    <h1>AVIATION</h1>
    <h2>HOW AIRCRAFT FLY</h2>
    <p>Aircraft generate lift by moving air faster over the wing than under it, 
    creating a pressure difference. Thrust from engines moves the aircraft forward, drag resists motion, 
    and weight pulls the aircraft toward Earth. Controlled balance of these four forces enables flight.</p>
    <h/>
    <h2>TYPES OF AIRCRAFT</h2>
    <p>There are multiple types of aircraft but the most common are the following 3</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Fixed-Wing Aircraft</li>
        <li>Rotary-Wing Aircraft</li>
        <li>Gliders</li>
    <ol></ol> 
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Fixed-Wing Aircraft

These aircraft use rigid wings to generate lift and must maintain forward motion 
to stay airborne. Fixed-wing aircraft are used in commercial airlines, cargo transport,
 and military operations. Examples include jet airliners and light training planes.</p>

        <li>
            <p>Rotary-Wing Aircraft

Rotary-wing aircraft, commonly known as helicopters, generate lift using rotating blades.
They can hover, take off vertically, and operate in confined spaces, making them ideal for rescue missions,
 medical transport, and surveillance.</p>

        </li>
        <li><p>Gliders

Gliders are unpowered aircraft that rely on air currents and thermals to remain airborne. They are 
primarily used for sport flying and flight training to develop precision control and situational awareness.</p>
